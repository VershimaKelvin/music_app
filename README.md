## Project Overview
This is a simple music play app with a beautiful UI, this app was created to mimic spotify, its almost similar to spotify but not as vast as spotify. Flutter was the framework used to build the app

## Installation
To get the source code up and running on your computer, you need to first install an IDE, preferably [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmKiQBhClARIsAKtSj-mCE3Dc0T4FuVNp5WzCsOKbAIlaTP-7DuCYL-p5D8PZbAPgfU6IizEaAuYyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), follow instructions that pop up while installing Android studio.
After it has successfully installed, install the flutter plugin and download Dart SDK, instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmKiQBhClARIsAKtSj-lDkI-zjlymTZot1n0GglKPrghu2aqO_4cwNH_bZUuLGbCyh_Dwun0aAqgDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). when that is done,
